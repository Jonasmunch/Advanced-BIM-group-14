Group 14 - Reflection on feedback for A4

The process of creating the tool
•	Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
•	Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
•	Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

In creating our BIM tool, we have through most of the process been quite ‘stationary’ in our thinking of how the tool should work. 
This as we only thought of it as a tool to extract information for later structural analysis. 
With the ‘midway’ feedback from Tim and the visiting engineers from Niras BIM department, 
we re-thought the tool to work more as a tool for evaluating the quality of the information needed for structural analysis. 
Also presenting the output statistics in a visual interface instead of a list as it initially was thought out. 

For the main part of the group the course might not have had too much influence on the future master thesis, 
but for some of us the course has sparked some ideas on what it could contain. 

On the matter of the use cases, our group had a bit of a slow start on figuring out our use case, 
although we were sure about it being in the ‘Structural’ category. 
But in the end, we think that the group profited from the work in process of figuring out the use case.
The number of tools in the course is to some extend needed and important for getting some understanding of the scope of BIM, 
although we thought Speckle to be somewhat superfluous. 


The output of the tool:
•	did the tool address the use case you identified?
•	was the use case well modelled
•	was the project clearly scoped

Our own thoughts:
The tool addresses the use case we worked with, as it extracted all the structural elements for that specific IFC file. 
However, when we started the project with an intention and hope for that it could be used in a more general way. 
But the naming of the elements in the different files could not make that happen. 

So that would make the modelling of the use case not so smooth, because the model is not so flexible. 

The scoping of the project did help a lot with the bpmn file that was made early on. It was a brilliant way to visualise your ideas and give a good overview. 
The file helped us a lot when we started the project. It was nice to have this overview so we could delegate the objectives in making this tool. 

The feedback given for this tool was also very nice, because we wanted to show the idea of the tool being 
a whole program and not just a boring list/schedule in this short time we had programming it. 
And also, to let the people that are working on the project know whether there is an error in the model while working with the given BIM file.


Peer feedback:
In general, the peer feedback thought the tool addressed a good problem, and thought the output was well made, and a good idea to use excel for the output.
  
For the peer feedback the general point that was made, was to incorporate some of the projects made by the other groups, 
like a website that could be used to interact with the data and show it in a 3D model where the elements are located.  
Also, the output could include some more checks on the data, like if the elements is defined correct, or if there was overlapping elements. 
The output could also do some calculation with the found data like the load capacity, weight, and more. 

Some feedback was about structural elements as definition of ‘structural elements’, our code took in all the elements whether they are structural or not. 
This was done because the IFC model was believed to be inaccurate about what it had marked as a structural element or non-structural.


Future:
•	Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?

Although it could be interesting to build further on the idea of making the structural modelling  structural calculations process easier and more intuitive, 
it is currently not on our scope in terms of writing a thesis. Neither is the general idea of using OpenBIM, IFC or similar.

•	Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?

The use of OpenBIM should be implemented more in the building industry in the future. This course has illustrated how much time, 
money and work can be saved if IFC or other software were implemented in the process of making buildings, bridges etc. 
Therefore, it is likely that we will see more of OpenBIM in the building industry, 
which therefore makes it very likely that we will use OpenBIM tools in our professional life in the next 10 years.


Course feedback:
•	Good effort! I like how you focused on the completeness of the model and offered feedback before the calculations. 
I would be interested to hear what you think the next steps are?

The next steps are to make the excel into an online dashboard on a website or a program that is more sensible to use than excel. 
For the purpose of making, it more intuitive to use and see an overview of where the errors occurred in the modelling process.
The dashboard is especially aimed at non-architects/-engineers who wish to know the status of the modelling process.
A way to make it to an online dashboard could be via Speckle, which could translate the python script and making it viable for 
the program or website that would display the dashboard.
